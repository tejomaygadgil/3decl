Part-of-Speech Tagging for Classical Greek üè∫
==============================
This project builds a fine-trained [part-of-speech tagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) for Ancient Classical Greek, a [morphologically rich](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01330.pdf) and [low-resource](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07264.pdf) language, using texts from [The Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/) and ideas inspired by [*Speech and Language Processing*](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).

# Model
Ancient Greek is hard to parse due to its use of [word endings](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Ancient_Greek_grammar_tables)[^1] to indicate part-of-speech.

This means we cannot necessarily rely on [classical methods that rely heavily on use word order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)  to make predictions.


[^1]: This is in contrast to [analytics languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language) like English that use word order and special words like "had" and "will" to express part-of-speech.

[^2]: Therefore, while most of English follows only [eight inflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection#Examples_in_English), a single Greek verb can have [hundreds of word endings](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CF%8D%CF%89#Inflection) to express every combination of person, number, mood, aspect, voice.
