Part-of-Speech Tagging for Classical Greek üè∫
==============================
The goal of this project is to implement and train a [part-of-speech (POS) tagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) for Ancient Classical Greek, a [morphologically rich](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01330.pdf) and [low-resource](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07264.pdf) language, using texts from [The Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/) and modeling techniques inspired by Jurafsky and Martin's [*Speech and Language Processing*](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).
