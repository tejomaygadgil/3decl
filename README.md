Part-of-Speech Tagging for Classical Greek üè∫
==============================
This project builds a fine-trained [part-of-speech tagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) for Ancient Classical Greek, a [morphologically rich](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01330.pdf) and [low-resource](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07264.pdf) language, using texts from [The Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/) and ideas inspired by [*Speech and Language Processing*](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).

# Model

# Run the code
Instructions to run this repository:
## Get environment
Packages are managed by setting up a `poetry` environment:
1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. In the terminal, run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tejomaygadgil/cgpos.git
$ cd cgpos/
$ make activate_poetry
poetry install
Installing dependencies from lock file

No dependencies to install or update

Installing the current project: cgpos (0.1.0)
...
```

## Get data
Grab project data:
```
$ cd /dir/to/repository
$ make make_dataset
Initializing data directory
mkdir data/raw/zip
Grabbing Perseus data
...
```

Data will automatically be downloaded to `cgpos/data/` and cleaned.

All data can be removed at any time using this command: 
```
$ make remove_all_data 
```

## Running the model
Build project features using this command:
```
$ cd /dir/to/repository
$ make build_features
Initializing data directory
Building features
python src/cgpos/features/build_features.py
...
```

Run the model using: 
```
$ cd /dir/to/repository
$ make run_model # TODO
```
