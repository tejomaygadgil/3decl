Part-of-Speech Tagging for Classical Greek üè∫
==============================
This project builds a fine-trained [part-of-speech tagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) from scratch for Ancient Classical Greek, a [morphologically rich](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01330.pdf) and [low-resource](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07264.pdf) language. We use texts from [The Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/) and ideas inspired by [*Speech and Language Processing*](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).
